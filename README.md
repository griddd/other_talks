Less-technical speaking engagements

This folder contains presentations & slides from talks I've given to groups other than info security people.  Folks who are non-IT, or
your run-of-the-mill average Joe/Jane.

I enjoy these a lot, as educating novices on cyber security helps infosec improve everywhere!
